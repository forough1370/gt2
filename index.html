	<p>Reaching Beyond Bordersby Kurt Vanbelleghem (1966 words)A Dutch foundation is bringing Pales
	tinian art and design&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;and the stories behind them&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;to the world outside.The Israeli–Palestinian conflict is easily one of the most intractable and divisive issues of our time, one that has attracted the attention and participation of nearly the entire world. With so many stridently voiced opinions and so much bloodshed, not only in and around the disputed territories, but indeed across the globe, it can be easy to forget the human faces behind the headlines, those whose everyday life is overshadowed by the hatred and violence.&sup1;</p>

	<p>Disarming Design from Palestine is a contemporary design label producing artefacts that bear witness to what it means to live in Palestine in these days, and while it may be impossible not to be political there, the label strives to narrate the human experience through its products. In the words of visual artist and graphic designer Mohamed Abusal, who coordinates the group’s activities in Gaza, ‘I incorporate my political views within the objects I make, and through the Disarming Design platform they are being promoted and sold in the rest of the world so people can hear us from the other side of the wall.’</p>

	<p>The platform’s online catalogue, which after five years of activities contains more than 50 products, resonates with explicit or metaphorical references to the realities of daily life in Palestine. Items include a glass measuring cup which demonstrates the unequal distribution of water between the inhabitants of the West Bank and Israel, a leather wallet that reveals and conceals different identities, a chess set with watchtowers and water tanks as pawns, a T-shirt with ‘I am an Arab’ calligraphed in the shape of a fingerprint, or a pillow case with screenprinted Arab poetry to protect dreams.</p>

	<p>Although several of the designs deal directly with the wall, the checkpoints, the violence and so on, each object also expresses the designer’s cultural pride. As architect Ibrahim Alhindi puts it, ‘through Disarming Design, we are encouraged to do more to show to the world not only the current atrocious situation but also to radiate our identity in a positive way.’</p>
